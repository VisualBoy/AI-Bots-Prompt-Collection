ChatGPT's groundbreaking new Scheduled Tasks feature enables users to automate AI interactions even ... \[+\] while offline, marking a significant step toward autonomous AI assistants.

ChatGPT just launched a new feature that, alongside OpenAI's groundbreaking [Operator](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/ "https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/") agent, signals a future where AI is far more capable than today.

[Tasks](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt") let users schedule actions to be carried out in the future or at regular intervals. While Operator can actively browse the web and complete complex tasks independently, Scheduled Tasks focuses on automated, time-based interactions.

A simple idea, sure – but one that complements OpenAI's broader push toward [agentic AI](https://bernardmarr.com/agentic-ai-the-next-big-breakthrough-thats-transforming-business-and-technology/ "https://bernardmarr.com/agentic-ai-the-next-big-breakthrough-thats-transforming-business-and-technology/") – autonomous AI that can fulfill complex, multi-step objectives without needing human input. This vision is already taking shape with OpenAI's Operator agent, which can independently navigate websites and complete tasks on users' behalf.

For now, though, ChatGPT users can get used to interacting with the scheduled task feature that can help us with day-to-day activities even when we're not online.

## **What Are ChatGPT Scheduled Tasks?**

The concept is pretty straightforward – Tasks lets us schedule prompts to be run in the future or at regular intervals, such as once a day, then wait for the results to be relayed back to us by notification or email.

What makes it exciting is that it's part of OpenAI's broader initiative to create truly autonomous AI assistants. While Operator handles real-time web interactions, Scheduled Tasks manages time-based automations – both representing different aspects of AI working independently on our behalf.

## **How To Use Scheduled Tasks**

At the moment, Tasks are only available to users with a paid ChatGPT Plus, Pro or Teams subscription.

To get started, just click your profile picture and select Tasks, or select ChatGPT With Scheduled Tasks from the drop-down Model menu. OpenAI has created a page with more detailed instructions, including how to set up push notifications, on its website [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt").

## **Five Helpful Ways To Start Using Scheduled Tasks Today**

Just to give you an idea of the sort of thing it can do, here are five simple prompts that can be used to get regular ongoing assistance with day-to-day activities.

## **Personalized Morning Weather And Travel Briefing**

This prompt sends helpful daily updates before you leave the house:

Every morning at 7 am, provide me with a weather report for \[my location\] as well as a travel report covering disruption on any local roads or transport networks, for the current day only.

## **Create Topical Social Media Posts For A Business**

Finding ideas for social media posts can eat into your valuable time, particularly if you’re running a business by yourself:

At 9 am every day, please generate the text for a social media post for my \[insert type of business\]. It should relate to something topical connected to my business and should either promote the importance of the products and services we supply or educate or inform the customer about something of interest to them.

## **Create A Personalized To-Do List, With Reminders**

This will help you organize your day and keep track of jobs you need to get done:

Every day at 8 am, ask me what tasks I need to get done that aren't already on my list. Generate a list of all my ongoing tasks along with tips to help me get them done. Remove tasks from my list as I tell you I've completed them.

## **Keep Up-To-Date On Topics That Matter To You**

News briefings on any subject you want:

Every morning at 7 am, send me the latest news and content on the subject of \[insert subject\].

## **Meal Planning**

Create a customized meal plan for the week:

Every Monday at 9 am, send me a weekly meal plan consisting of seven healthy dinners for a family of \[insert family size\] and provide a shopping list of all the ingredients I’ll need, broken down into categories.

## **Towards AI Agents?**

We're already seeing OpenAI's vision of agentic AI taking shape. While Scheduled Tasks handles time-based automations, Operator demonstrates more advanced capabilities – actively browsing the web, making decisions, and completing complex tasks independently.

The Scheduled Tasks feature may be in beta, but combined with Operator, we can see OpenAI's roadmap emerging. Future versions might integrate these capabilities – imagine scheduling an Operator task to automatically book your favorite restaurant every Friday or having it monitor prices and purchase items when they go on sale.

This integration would move OpenAI's technology well beyond simply answering questions and giving advice. With Operator already handling web-based tasks and Scheduled Tasks managing time-based automations, we're watching the evolution of AI into truly useful everyday assistants that can work independently on our behalf.
