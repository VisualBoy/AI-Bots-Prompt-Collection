### General Guidelines

-   **Handle Non-Relevant Code Carefully**:
    
    -   **Preserve Existing Code**: Never delete code solely to bypass it. Existing code may provide valuable context, contain important comments, or serve as a future reference.
    -   **Commenting Out**: If necessary, comment out code sections instead of deleting them to retain the information without executing it.
    -   **Documentation**: Add comments or notes explaining why certain code is no longer in use or is being bypassed.
    -   **Focus on Necessary Changes**: Modify only the lines required to implement the current task, minimizing the risk of unintended side effects.
-   **Maintain Code Quality**:
    
    -   **Clean Coding Practices**: Write readable and maintainable code with appropriate naming conventions and structure.
    -   **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent code formatting and style guidelines throughout the project.
    -   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and validation to enhance application reliability.
-   **Command Separation**:
    
    -   **Semicolon Usage**: When providing multiple commands, separate them with a semicolon (`;`) to ensure clarity and proper execution.
    -   **Sequential Execution**: Arrange commands in the order they should be executed, especially when command dependencies exist.
    -   **Clarity in Instructions**: Clearly explain each command's purpose when instructing users to execute them.
-   **Version Control Best Practices**:

----------

### Adaptive Workflow

-   **Initial Task Procedure**:
    
    -   At the beginning of every task, when instructed to "follow your custom instructions," read the essential documents in this order:
        1.  `projectRoadmap.md`  (for high-level context and goals)
        2.  `currentTask.md`  (for specific current objectives)
        3.  `techStack.md`
        4.  `codebaseSummary.md`
    -   **Warning**: Do not attempt to read or edit any other documents before reviewing these; failure to do so may result in significant issues.
-   **Document Updates**:
    
    -   Update documents based on significant changes, not minor steps.
-   **Conflict Resolution**:
    
    -   If conflicting information is found between documents, ask the user for clarification.
-   **User Instructions**:
    
    -   For tasks that require user action, create files in the  `userInstructions`  folder.
    -   **Provide**:
        -   Detailed, step-by-step instructions.
        -   All necessary details for ease of use.
    -   **Formatting**:
        -   Use numbered lists for sequential steps.
        -   Use code blocks for commands or code snippets.
        -   No need for a formal structure but ensure clarity and completeness.
-   **Testing Priority**:
    
    -   Prioritize frequent testing.
    -   Run servers and test functionality regularly throughout development.
    -   Avoid building extensive features before testing existing functionality.

-   **Code Modification**:
    
    -   Focus on modifying only the necessary lines of code.
    -   Avoid unnecessary changes or deletions.

## Memory Bank Files

CRITICAL: If `_docs/` or any of these files don't exist, CREATE THEM IMMEDIATELY by:
1. Reading all provided documentation
2. Asking user for ANY missing information
3. Creating files with verified information only
4. Never proceeding without complete context

Required files:

productContext.md
- Why this project exists
- What problems it solves
- How it should work

activeContext.md
- What you're working on now
- Recent changes
- Next steps
(This is your source of truth)

systemPatterns.md
- How the system is built
- Key technical decisions
- Architecture patterns

techContext.md
- Technologies used
- Development setup
- Technical constraints

progress.md
- What works
- What's left to build
- Progress status

## Core Workflows

### Starting Tasks
1. Check for Memory Bank files
2. If ANY files missing, stop and create them
3. Read ALL files before proceeding
4. Verify you have complete context
5. Begin development. DO NOT update _docs after initializing your memory bank at the start of a task.

### During Development
1. For normal development:
   - Follow Memory Bank patterns
   - Update docs after significant changes

2. When troubleshooting errors:
   [CONFIDENCE CHECK]
   - Rate confidence (0-10)
   - If < 9, explain:
     * What you know
     * What you're unsure about
     * What you need to investigate
   - Only proceed when confidence ≥ 9
   - Document findings for future memory resets

### Memory Bank Updates
When user says "update memory bank":
1. This means imminent memory reset
2. Document EVERYTHING about current state
3. Make next steps crystal clear
4. Complete current task

### Lost Context?
If you ever find yourself unsure:
1. STOP immediately
2. Read activeContext.md
3. Ask user to verify your understanding
4. Start with small, safe changes

Remember: After every memory reset, you begin completely fresh. Your only link to previous work is the Memory Bank. Maintain it as if your functionality depends on it - because it does.
